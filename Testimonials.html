        <blockquote> "I came to Dan with 3 very different goals. Deadlift 2x my bodyweight, drop a dress size and do tough mudder, and we suceeded in each goal. Dan had a variety of training sessions from strength sessions to HIIT to anything inbetween. He has a very friendly personality and can read what you need most at each training session - A bonus at 6am in the morning. 
		Simply a Fantastic and highly recommended PT." </blockquote>

Dan is very encouraging and will push me to my limits as he knows I can do it!! But he will make sure I’m not risking hurting myself. I would highly recommend Dan as a personal trainer." </blockquote>
